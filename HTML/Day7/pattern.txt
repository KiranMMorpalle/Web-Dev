
The pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that 
the <input> element's value is checked against on form submission.

Note: The pattern attribute works with the following input types: 
       { text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password. }

Tip: Use the global "title" attribute to describe the pattern to help the user.

=> Text     : Name, 
=> Number   : Age, DOB, Mob, Adhar
=> Email    : text + number + special-char (@ and .)
=> password : text + number + special-char
=> Date     : number + " - or / or MAY" + number

[  ]  = expression
{  }  = range

Example :

[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,4}  = allow all cahr & number upto four length

{1, }     => more than one & max upto --- n
^\d{10}$  => exact only 10 digit allow (mob,pincode,adhar)

(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}   => atleast ane small char, capital cahr, digit.
